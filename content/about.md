My name is Matthew Toms-Zuberec, and I'm the author of this site. I made it to help share information I come across and ideas or thoughts I have.

I am currently a security consultant for Bulletproof Solutions, and am actively pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a focus on cybersecurity. I am an experienced information security professional, and mainly have worked as a penetration tester and red-teamer.

I am currently working towards different certifications in the information security industry.

I have a strong background in development, both web and software, which led me to branch into security. 

We all know how hard is to keep up to date in the infosec world, especially since things move fast and security/threats are ever changing. My goal is to share new information and concepts, and to bring a new perspective to managing risk and the vast world of security.
