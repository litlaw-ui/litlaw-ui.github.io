          My name is Matthew Toms-Zuberec, and I&amp;rsquo;m the author of this site. I made it to help share information I come across and ideas or thoughts I have.
I am (currently) an independent security researcher and reverse engineer, and am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I have already held multiple entry level positions, and am working towards different certifications in the information security industry.
I have a strong background in development, both web and software, which led me to branch into security.
